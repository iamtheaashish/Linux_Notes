# The following RHCSA exam objectives are covered in this chapter:
#   Manage default permissions
#   List, set, and change standard ugo/rwx permissions
#   Create and configure set-GID directories for collaboration
#   Diagnose and correct file permission problems
=============================================================================================
" It may on occasion be useful to get a list of all files on the system that have a given user
 or group as owner."

$ find / -user username
# Finds all files owned by the specified user.
# A user becomes the owner of a file when they create it. Although ownership can be changed later.
$ find / -group groupname
# Finds all files owned by the specified group.
# A group becomes the owner of a file when it is created in a directory that has that group as its
# group owner. Although ownership can be changed later.
=============================================================================================
< Changing User Ownership >
$ chown who what
$ chown linda files
# Changes the owner of the specified files to the user 'linda'.
$ chown -R linda files 
# Recursively changes the owner of the specified files and directories to the user 'linda'.

< Changing Group Ownership >
We have two ways to change the group ownership of files:
1. Using chown command
2. Using chgrp command
Preferred way is to use chgrp command.

$ chown .account /home/account/
or 
$ chown :account /home/account/ # Preferred syntax
# Changes the group ownership of the specified directory to 'account' group.
--OR--
$ chgrp account /home/account/
# Changes the group ownership of the specified directory to 'account' group.
=============================================================================================
< Understanding Default Ownership >
"By default, when a user creates a file, the user becomes the owner of that file, and the group
owner is set to the userâ€™s primary group (as defined in /etc/passwd)."

$ newgrp groupname
# Changes the current primary group to 'groupname' for the duration of the session.
# This affects the group ownership of newly created files during this session.
This group will continue to be used as the effective primary group until user 
linda uses the exit command or logs out.

$ groups lisa
# Displays the groups that the user 'lisa' is a member of.

< Managing Basic Permissions >
"Linux File Permissions were invented in 1970s. There are three types of permissions: read (r),
write (w), and execute (x). These permissions can be set for three different categories of users:
the file owner (user), the group owner (group), and others (world)."

+ READ (r) Permission
  Allows a user to read the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
But for directories, read permissions only allow you to list the files in the directory,
not access them. YOU NEED READ permissions on the FILES inside the directory to view them.

If you have both READ and EXECUTE permissions on a directory, 
you can list the files and access them.

+ WRITE (w) Permission
  Allows a user to modify the contents of a file or add/remove files in a directory.

You need WRITE permission on a directory to create, delete, or rename files within that directory.

+ EXECUTE (x) Permission
  Allows a user to execute a file (if it is a program or script) or access a directory.
For directories, EXECUTE permission allows you to enter the directory and access its contents,
provided you have the necessary permissions on the files themselves.

"Permissions can be represented in two ways: symbolic notation (rwx) and octal notation (numeric)."
"In symbolic notation, permissions are represented using letters: r (read), w (write), x (execute),
and - (no permission). In octal notation, permissions are represented using numbers: 4 (read), 
2 (write), 1 (execute), and 0 (no permission). The sum of these numbers represents the combined 
permissions."

To set permissions using numbers, calculate the sum for each category:
- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

For example:
$ chmod 755 /somefile 
# Sets READ-WRITE-EXEC for File Owner (7 = 4+2+1)
# Sets READ-EXECUTE for Group Owner (5 = 4+0+1)
# Sets READ-EXECUTE for Others (5 = 4+0+1)
$ chmod 640 /somefile
# Sets READ-WRITE for File Owner (6 = 4+2+0)
# Sets READ for Group Owner (4 = 4+0+0)
# Sets NO PERMISSIONS for Others (0 = 0+0+0)

`MORE EXAMPLES OF chmod COMMAND:`
$ chmod +x /somefile
# Adds EXECUTE permission for all categories (user, group, others) on /somefile
$ chmod g-w /somefile
# Removes WRITE permission for the group owner on /somefile
$ chmod o=r /somefile
# Sets READ permission only for others on /somefile
$ chmod u+x,g+w,o-r /somefile
# Adds EXECUTE permission for the user, adds WRITE permission for the group,
# and removes READ permission for others on /somefile

"Files becoming executable in an uncontrolled way are a major security issue. 
For that reason, if you want to apply the execute permission in a recursive way,
you should apply it as X, not x. So instead of using chmod -R a+x files,
use chmod -R a+X files. This ensures that subdirectories will obtain the execute 
permission but the execute permission is not applied to any files."

$ chmod -R a+X ~/somedir
=============================================================================================
< Understanding Advanced Permissions >
+ There are three advanced permission settings in Linux:
1. Set User ID (setuid or SUID)
2. Set Group ID (setgid or SGID)
3. Sticky Bit
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Set User ID (setuid or SUID)
"When the setuid permission is set on an executable file, it allows users to run the file with
the permissions of the file owner, rather than their own permissions."
For example, the 'passwd' command has the setuid bit set, allowing users to change their passwords
even though the /etc/shadow file is owned by root.

```bash
[root@alma9 ~]# ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 32656 Apr 14  2022 /usr/bin/passwd 
``` # smaller case 's' indicates both suid and execute is set.

# If in case you find an uppercase 'S' in place of 's' like below:
```bash
-rwSr-xr-x. 1 root root 32656 Apr 14  2022 /usr/bin/passwd 
``` # it means execute permission is NOT set for user. Only suid is set.

+ Numeric representation of setuid is 4.
+ When combined with standard permissions, add 4 to the user (owner) permission digit.
For example, to set read, write, and execute permissions for the owner along with setuid,
read and execute for the group, and read and execute for others, you would use 4755.

$ chmod u+s /path/to/executable
# Sets the setuid permission on the specified executable file.
---------------------------------------------------------------
2. Set Group ID (setgid or SGID)
"It does two things, if it is applied to an executable file, it allows users to run the file with
the permissions of the file's group owner. If it is applied to a directory, it ensures that files
created within that directory inherit the group ownership of the directory, rather than the primary
group of the user who created the file."

+ Numeric representation of setgid is 2.
+ When combined with standard permissions, add 2 to the group permission digit.
For example, to set read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, read, write, and execute
for the group along with setgid, and read and execute for others, you would use 2775.

$ chmod g+s /path/to/directory
# Sets the setgid permission on the specified directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------
3. Sticky Bit
"When the sticky bit is set on a directory, it restricts file deletion within that directory.
Only the file owner, the directory owner, or the root user can delete or rename files
within that directory, regardless of the directory's write permissions."

When you apply sticky bit, a user can delete files only if one of the following is true:
The user has root access.
The user is owner of the file.
The user is owner of the directory where the file exists.

+ Lowercase 't' indicates both sticky bit and execute is set.
+ Uppercase 'T' indicates sticky bit is set but execute is NOT set.

+ Numeric representation of sticky bit is 1.
+ When combined with standard permissions, add 1 to the others permission digit.
For example, to set read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, 
read and execute for the group,
and read and execute along with sticky bit for others, you would use 1755.

$ chmod +t /path/to/directory
# Sets the sticky bit on the specified directory.
